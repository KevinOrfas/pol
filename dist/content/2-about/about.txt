15 Years has passed since I started learning about hair beauty. It has been a long but fruitful travel across the world. From the basic technique of Vidal Sassoon to master a true Method form of cutting hair, in which crafting, mastering some of the most desired forms.

My technique is compared to Sculpting. Each clientâ€™s hair according to their personality, likes, dislikes as a harmonious way to give confidence, elegance and trends, cutting out sharp edges to follow the soft movement of hair as nature intend to be.

My travels from the warm soil of Mexico to USA, Paris to Belgrade has brought me to London. Whilst in Paris, I accomplished many of my professional goals. Balayage and Free Hand was the colouring of choice. 3 years in Italy, I crafted and mastered my technique, developing my unique way of cutting hair - Technique Seamless -

- Mexican Wave - my blow dry, complimenting the cut in a harmonious way, named the best blow dry by The Financial Times How to spend it and Tatler Hair guide.

Some of my clientele include Pippa Middleton, Carol Middleton, Andrea Riseborough, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Sanjay Gupta, Clemence Poesy, Lea Seydoux, Poppy Delavigne, Irina Shayx, Brian Ferry, Bianca Jagger and Worldwide Royalty.

Whilst travelling the world and teaching, I have now settled in London. I am now a part of Prive Deux style team and Artistic Stylist of Gielly Green Boutique Salon in London.
