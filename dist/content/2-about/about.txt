Throughout my professional career, which now spans more than 13 years, I have had the fortune of meeting and working alongside incredible icons of Haute Coiffure. Not only have they taught me everything I know, but also instilled in me the desire to always provide the best and to continuously search for perfection. 

It was this desire that had me move from Mexico to the US in 2001. I worked across the country and it was during this time that I began developing my style. I had in mind a woman who was naturally beautiful and sophisticated, yet approachable. My then mentor, Ginger Evans, and his approach to elegance and love of cinema inspired developing this look. 

In 2009, I realized it was time for me to continue my quest towards developing my craft and after a brief stopover in Mexico City I moved to Paris. 
I immediately feel in love with the city, its language and glamorous yet simple lifestyle. Instilled with newly found creativity, I started working with several photographers and magazines on editorial content and it was also in Paris where I met Rosanno Ferretti, who up to this day, continues to be my guiding light in the road to professional success. 

In 2010 I moved to Parma under the auspices of Rossano. It was there that I was able to, side-by-side, experiment, develop and learn what is in my opinion the best in hairdressing technique from my great mentor Lorenza Ferreti, Rossanoâ€™s sister. Lorenza is the creative developer behind the Rossano Ferretti Method. Under her watchful and caring eye, I refined my style to levels of technical and creative accomplishment I had never imagined possible. It was also during this time that I traveled around Italy and Slovakia and had the chance not only to attend great workshops but impart some of them too. In Bratislava we taught to an audience of more than 10,000 hairdressers.
