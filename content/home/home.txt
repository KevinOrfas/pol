Section-three-heading: Balayage

----

Section-text-three: Balayage (from the French 'to sweep') for extra depth and dimension. These are freestyle, hand-painted highlights which make hair look naturally sun-kissed and need less maintenance than more formulaic highlights (where traditional foiling or a colour cap is used) or solid block colour. They can last for up to four months before needing a touch-up.
