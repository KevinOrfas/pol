Wash your hair he day before to give it a little more "grip" any dirtier the hair can look opaque and lose shine. Spray the lengths of the hair with a heat protective styling spray. Divide hair into 3 sections to allow control.
Using a one inch size tong start from the back tonging each section, parallel to the next concentrating more on the front of the sections. Then, section off a a side parting and sweep across smithing the crown over, before using your hand fingers together like a paddle to "mould" the position of the curl.

Pin each "finger wave " ( the kink of the wave) with a section clip or grip, alternating each placement of the grip, back to front spray lightly with setting hairspray and let it set for 20 minutes.

Once your waves are prepared and set, loose the pins and lightly brush then sweep the the hair around one side and pin securely.

Gently bring around the front main section and bring around pin both sections together loosely around each other into a soft bun. Spray with hair spray and is all done.
